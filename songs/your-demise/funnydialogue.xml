        That blue-haired kid gave it to me when I showed up.
    </line>

    <line char="monikasad">
        I don't know where he got it.
    </line>

    <line char="monikasad">
        I don't even know how I got here, for that matter.

        You got his girl too?

    <line char="senpaihappy">
        Hah! I bet you really pissed that worm off!

        I wish I was there to see the look on his hideous baby face.
    </line>

    <line char="monikasad">
        He was mad...
    </line>

    <line char="monikagasp">
        ...hm?
    </line>

    <line char="senpaihappy">
        Your performance wasn't half bad earlier.
    </line>

    <line char="senpaihappy">
        Care for another song?
