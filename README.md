# Acknowledgements/things to know

*Keep in mind that these mods are ported by a couple of nerds, teens, or kids with their own lives and priorities who just want to contribute **for free.** Don't expect perfect code, performance, or an insane level of quality from a popular mod.*

*The team members don't necessarily research every mod in existence. Stop assuming we support criminals when our intention has nothing to do with it.*

*Mods who have a big no-no stamp from the majority of the community are **NOT** welcome, such as Bob and Bosip.*

*Nostalgic Funkin' is going to semi-separate the art from the artist (obviously with some exceptions, such as Dreams of Roses from Monika Rebooted).*

*We credit the original creators for the sake of crediting their work, controversial or not. It doesn't directly mean we support said creators.*

*We don't have plans on moving CNE to another engine at the moment.*

# What the funk is Nostalgic Funkin'???

Nostalgic Funkin' is a mod pack aimed at porting most classic mods from three years ago or to be specific, mods from Kade Engine era that made an impact such as Vs Tricky, Vs Whitty, Vs Tabi, B sides, etc to a more modern engine this mod pack uses which is called Codename Engine.

Main porters are:
MAZ, NullifiedAce, Tsaku, Notbeep-,- (Itzbeepi77), SorbetLover (Alloy).

## Navigation (File Management Aspect)
Here are some cool stuff to make navigating stuff easier without breaking anything:

Because of the +100 songs in there and the ungodly number of scripts and stages to keep track of, I setup tags for them, so you would know which songs and its' stage belong to what mod.
Here's how to enable it (It's only tested on Windows 10, I dunno about others):

This is also the same for images except the tags part.
They're in separate folders instead, so you can navigate pretty easily.
Like this one which is for character images:
